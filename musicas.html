        <h2>Post Malone - Circles</h2>

        <p>
            We couldn’t turn around <br>
            Til we were upside down <br>
            I’ll be the bad guy now <br>
            But know I ain’t too proud <br>
            I couldn’t be there <br>
            Even when I tried <br>
            You don’t believe it <br>
            We do this every time <br>
            <br>
            Seasons change and our love went cold <br>
            Feed the flame because we can’t let go <br>
            Runaway but we’re running in circles <br>
            Runaway, runaway <br>
            I dare you to do something <br>
            I’m waiting on you again <br>
            So I don’t take the blame <br>
            Runaway but we’re running in circles <br>
            Runaway, runaway, runaway <br>
            <br>
            Let go <br>
            I got a feeling that it’s time to let go <br>
            I said so <br>
            I knew that this was doomed from the get go <br>
            You thought that it was special, special <br>
            But it was just the sex though, the sex though <br>
            And I still hear the echoes, the echoes <br>
            I got a feeling that it’s time to let it go <br>
            Let it go <br>
            <br>
            Seasons change and our love went cold <br>
            Feed the flame because we can’t let go <br>
            Runaway but we’re running in circles <br>
            Runaway, runaway <br>
            I dare you to do something <br>
            I’m waiting on you again <br>
            So I don’t take the blame <br>
            Runaway but we’re running in circles <br>
            Runaway, runaway, runaway <br>
            <br>
            Maybe you don’t understand what I’m going thru <br>
            It’s only me, what you got to lose <br>
            Make up your mind, tell me what are you gonna do <br>
            It’s only me, let it go <br>
            <br>
            Seasons change and our love went cold <br>
            Feed the flame because we can’t let go <br>
            Runaway but we’re running in circles <br>
            Runaway, runaway <br>
            I dare you to do something <br>
            I’m waiting on you again <br>
            So I don’t take the blame <br>
            Runaway but we’re running in circles <br>
            Runaway, runaway, runaway <br>
